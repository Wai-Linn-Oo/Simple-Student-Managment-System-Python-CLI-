Student Management System (Python + MySQL)

A simple command-line-based Student Management System built with Python and MySQL.
This project demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and integrates a MySQL database with Python for real-world backend logic practice.

Features

âœ… Add Student â€“ Insert new student records into the database.
âœ… View Students â€“ Display all students in a tabular format.
âœ… Update Student â€“ Edit a specific student's details (name, age, email, or course).
âœ… Delete Student â€“ Remove a student record by roll number.
âœ… Search Students â€“ Search by name or course keyword.
âœ… MySQL Integration â€“ Uses a persistent database (sms_simple).
âœ… Formatted Output â€“ Uses the tabulate library for clean table display.
